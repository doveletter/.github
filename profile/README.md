## Learn the Latest News and Knowledge About Android & Kotlin

Dove Letter is a private subscription repository designed to help you learn, discuss, and share knowledge about Android and Kotlin. It keeps you informed with the latest articles, best practices, code samples, updates from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and news about the Android/Kotlin ecosystem. Unlike typical newsletters, Dove Letter delivers valuable tips and insights irregularly but frequently, curated by the author, ensuring you receive the most relevant content at the right time.

## Enjoy Tips With Code

One of the main reasons Dove Letter launched on GitHub is that it’s an ideal platform for sharing small but valuable code snippets and ideas — too detailed for social media but not extensive enough for a full blog post. GitHub allows for easy collaboration, and Dove Letter is open for contributions from anyone. If you have a great idea or tip, feel free to share it with the community and benefit from their feedback!

These tips will be summarized and compiled into a PDF file once they accumulate to more than 10 items, and will be delivered every 1-2 months.

## Learn With Interview Questions

One of the key benefits of subscribing to Dove Letter is that it regularly delivers industry-relevant interview questions focused on Android, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). These questions are commonly asked in tech interviews, so by simply reading them each day, you'll gradually build up your knowledge. Over several months or a year, you'll be well-prepared to tackle these topics.

## Explore History Effectively

One of the great features of the Dove Letter GitHub repository is the ability to search and filter history directly on the issue page. All commits and updates are summarized and archived every 1–4 weeks through GitHub releases based on content volume rather than a fixed schedule. However, you can also explore the entire history in markdown format by topic and easily filter topics using GitHub labels on the pull request page, making it simple to find and review specific content.

## Suggest and Discuss with Other Subscribers

Subscribers can actively engage by sharing useful articles, references, and code samples via GitHub issues, sparking discussions within the repository. If you discover an article or open-source project that you find particularly valuable or educational, you can initiate a conversation by creating an issue on GitHub. This collaborative approach allows you to contribute to the community and learn from the insights and experiences of others.

If you have any concerns or doubts about your team project or individual work, don’t hesitate to bring up any discussion topics. Engaging in open dialogue can lead to better solutions and clarity for everyone involved.

## Learning From AOSP

You can deepen your understanding by exploring the AOSP (Android Open Source Project), the backbone of all Android systems, including AndroidX Jetpack libraries and view systems. Dove Letter will provide valuable insights into AOSP topics, featuring the latest AOSP commits along with commentary from the author, helping you stay up-to-date and informed.
